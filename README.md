# Overview of the analysis

The main purpose of the analysis is to propose a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. 

As a first step, Python Pandas is used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then using converted csv file, we would add visualizations in Tabluea worksheets and create a Tabluea story to do a final presentation 

# Results

# Summary

Overall from all the visulations, we can conclude that there are more MALE riders compared to FEMALE/UNKNOWWN riders with an average trip duration of 4-6 hours and busiest time during weekday is Thursday 6pm and more riders have subscription. 

## Two Additional Visualizations

 - "Checkout Times by birth year" so that we can understand what age group is renting more bikes.
 - "User Trips by birth year by Weekday" to get an idea of number of bike trips by age for each hour for each day of the week.
